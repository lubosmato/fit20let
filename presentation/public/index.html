# Version Control System
* Theory
* Git
* GitLab (+ registration and project creation)

---

# Version control system - Theory

* Enables large scale colaboration
* Helps us to track changes
* Merging changes
* "The place, where the code is"

# Version control system - GitLab

* Web GUI to manage projects, branches, commits, pipelines, etc.
* Available to deploy in your company
* Has integrated CI/CD 

# Other systems
* GitHub
* Bitbucket
* Phabricator
* ...

---

# Version control system - GitLab

Festival FIT group:
* https://gitlab.com/festival-fit
* GroupID: 52369810

<br>

Tasks:
* Join the group [optional] - If you do not want to publish your e-mail, you can use: https://10minutemail.com/
* Create a new **private** project. Private is important, otherwise I will hack your computer.

# CI/CD

* Theory
* GitLab-runner
* GitLab-runner pipeline

---

# CI/CD

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
* CI/CD is a process of automating the deployment of software.
* Operates on your source
* Can do checks, tests, builds, deployments, etc.

Usually, you do subset of these steps:

1. Lint
1. Build
1. Test
1. Deploy

---

# CI/CD - GitLab

```yml
stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build

build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - echo "Compile complete."
```

---
  
```yml
stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  stage: build
  tags:
    - "win-laptop"
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - echo "Compile complete."

unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  tags:
    - "win-laptop"
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds."
    - sleep 60
    - echo "Code coverage is 90%"

lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
  tags:
    - "win-laptop"
  script:
    - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
    - sleep 10
    - echo "No lint issues found."

deploy-job:      # This job runs in the deploy stage.
  stage: deploy  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
  tags:
    - "win-laptop"
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - echo "Application successfully deployed."
```

# CI/CD - GitLab - Runner

* Go to your project
* Click on the **Settings**
* Click on the **CI/CD**
* Expand the **Runners** section
* In the left part, you can add Runner, you have there also instructions how to install and register it

> **Note:** Pay attention to the **tags** as those indentifies what job will be scheduled to what runner/executor

> **Warning:** On some installations, gitlab-runner tries to run `pwsh.exe` that is not available on your system. In order to fix it, edit `C:\Gitlab-runner\config.toml` and change the value of `shell` to `powershell`.

# CI/CD - GitLab - Pipeline

```yml
stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build

build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  stage: build
  tags:
    - "my-tag"
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - New-Item -Path "C:\\builds\\Public\\build" -ItemType Directory
    - echo "Compile complete."
```

# Docker - Containers

All you need to know is that Containers are a way to run applications on your computer in a separate environment, so it is completely isolated from your system.
